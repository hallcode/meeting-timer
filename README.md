# Meeting Timer
A simple JS meeting room timer.

# Install
The timer can be installed simply by moving the files on to your web server. No further installation or build is required.

## Requirements
This is written in ES6 with no fancy stuff to support older browsers. Therefore it will not work in 
Internet Exporer or some mobile browsers.

# Usage
Using the keypad on the screen, or the keyboard, use the numbers 1 to 9 to set the number of minutes on the timer. Then press Start (or press ```space```) to play/pause the timer.

You can press a new number at any time to reset the time on the clock without pausing.

## Adding time
You can press the + button (```=``` or ```shift```) to toggle add mode. In this mode, keypad/number keys will add time to the clock instead of reseting it. For example, pressing shift and then the number 5 twice, will add 10 minutes to the timer.

That's it!
